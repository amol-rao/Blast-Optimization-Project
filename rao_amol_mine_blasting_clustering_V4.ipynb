The efficiency of the blasting operation depends on a few key parameters, including; rock characteristics, properties and quantities of explosives, blast geometry, blast size, priming method and initiation sequence. \n\nAs part of this analysis, <strong> the geotechnical and blasting parameters </strong> will be explored to better understand groupings within the data. It is hoped the analysis can be used to eventually optimize blasting to reduce movement and make the fragmentation process more efficient. \n\n### 1.1) Analysis Method (Selected from Bibliography)\n\nData clustering refers to the unsupervised classification of features into patterns that then form meaningful groups. Data within 1 cluster are more similar than data in another cluster. As described by Jain et. al [8] there are four main components to a clustering task: \n\n* Pattern representation - Comprised of selection of the features and extraction for the dataset. This step also involves identifying number of classes in the representation.\n\n* Definition of pattern proximity - This is the distance function defined on the pairs of patterns. For example Euclidean distance is a common measure.\n\n* Clustering or grouping - There are many types of clustering techniques.  \n\n* Data abstraction - Once clustering has been done, a person with knowledge of the domain needs to identify what is represented and ensure the clusters are simple and compact for scalability. \n\n* Assessment of output - Perform some type of validity analysis on the cluster. \n\nHudaverdi [1] uses a hierarchical clustering technique to group 88 blast data into two groups of similarity. Blast design parameters such as burden, spacing, bench height and stemming as well as geotechnical data are used to to obtain two seperate clusters of data. Following this, each cluster is fed into a regression model to predict ground vibration, as indicated by a measure of the Peak Particle Velocity (PPV). A hierarchical technique is used to cluster all blasts into one of two groups. After standardization of the data, the Pearson coefficient of similarity is used to group data. \n\n### 1.3) Application to This Dataset\nDue to the constraint of using the MlLib toolkit - the clustering algorithm that will be explored in this analysis is the K-Means method. K-means is one of the most commonly used clustering algorithms that clusters the data points into a predefined number of clusters. The number of clusters is optimized by reducing the error on the within set sum of squared error. \n\nThe items to be clustered are <strong> individual blasts </strong> based on the features to be described later on this notebook. The blast data  was recorded with instrumentation and manually and provided by Professor Kamran Esmaeili for this investigation."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a id=\"plan\"></a>\n## 2.0) Project Plan & Task Breakdown\n\n<br/>\n### 2.1) Project Plan\n\nBased on the CRISP-DM method, these are the proposed tasks for the project:\n\n* <strong>Week 1 - Data Understanding</strong>\n  * Data Review \n  * Data verification (with mining professors)\n  * Exploratory analysis\n  * Review + identify potential analytics techniques\n \n* <strong>Week 2 - Data Preparation</strong>\n  * Data Cleaning\n  * Feature extraction and selection\n  * Integrate and format data for model\n  * Finalize modeling techniques to be used\n  \n* <strong>Week 3 - Modeling</strong>\n  * Implement selected modeling technique\n  * Build model\n  * Assess model by computing error\n  \n* <strong>Week 4 - Evaluation of Alternatives</strong>\n  * Evaluate alternative approaches to clustering\n  * Review process and next steps\n  \n\n<br/>\n### 2.2) Task Breakdown\nIt is anticipated that 10 hours will be allocated each week to perform the tasks required for completion of the project.\n<br/>\n#### 2.2.1) Data Understanding (Week 1)\nThe data understanding task involves the following steps: \n\n\n* Data Review  (1 hour)\n  * Review all tables to develop understanding of data \n\n* Data verification (3 hours)\n  * Meet with Mining Professors to better understand data\n  * Eliminate data not required or redundant \n  * Clarify required analyses \n\n* Exploratory analysis\n  * Completed by J.Ponn for select tables\n\n* Project planning (3 hours)\n  * Setup notebook\n  * Identify breakdown of tasks for each iteration\n  * Allocate time estimates for tasks\n\n* Revisions (1 hour)\n  * Group discussions about project plans\n  * Revisions based on feedback and discussion decisions\n\n* Misc (2 hours)\n  * Buffer for unexpected problems, or changes based on group discussion for this iteration\n  \n#### 2.2.2) Data Preparation (Week 2)\nThe data preparation task involves the following steps: \n\n\n* Data Cleaning (3 hours)\n  * Identify tables that need to be cleaned : the important tables are smry_pen_rate, smry_geotech, smry_movement, smry_bmm\n  * Normalize the text, remove duplicate or error entries\n* Feature extraction and pattern representation (3 hours)\n  * Identify features to be used for input to the model.\n  * Pattern representation consists of defining the number of classes and features to be used in the clustering algorithm.\n\n* Finalize modeling techniques to be used (2 hours)\n  * Model to be considered is the <strong> K-Means</strong>.  \n  * The spark.mllib implementation includes a parallelized variant of the k-means++ method called kmeans||.   \n* Misc.

This was also found with just the geotechnical dataset - which indicates validation of the initial test. This suggests that there are 3 underlying groupings of the data.\n* Upon reviewing the centroids of the coordinates, it was typically noted that two of the clusters were closer to each other than the third, however this alternated depending on which parameter was assessed. \n* The blast parameters did not provide useful discriminant data to perform the clustering. This was shown by utilizing just the geotechnical data and obtaining 3 clusters - the same result as conducted with blast parameters. This suggests that most blasts have very similar data points, and is supported by the graphical plots depicted in Section 3.\n\n\nThe following recommendations are made regarding data management and future work:\n* The dataset used for the final clustering was relatively small - only 217 points. This was as a result of data processing and cleaning which resulted in the removal of many datapoints. In order to build better models, a larger more accurate dataset should be collected. \n* The dataset used for the analysi (smry_bmm) contained many data that had been averaged from one location across many different points. This is understandable considering the limitations of data collections at a mine, however additional efforts should be made to collect discrete geospatial data which are representative - for example the RQD, Q, IS_50 attached to individual blast hole data points. \n* This analysis provided distinct clusters into which the data can be grouped based on similarity. Further work can develop regression models to predict movement or fragmentation based on the clusters. These will likely result in better predictive models. \n* Documentation for ML Lib is still being developed (or difficult to find) as such, detailed analysis on clusters was not possible. For example it would have been useful to see cluster assignments and relate it back to individual data points."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a id=\"bibliography\"></a>\n## 7.0) Bibliography\n<strong>Selected Paper:</strong><br/>\n<a id=\"ref1\"></a>\n[1] T.
